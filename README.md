# Unity-MiniTutorial-4-Unity-Cameras-to-MATLAB-Images
This tutorial is all about getting your camera frames into MATLAB images.

We will be using the Unity script from the [Unity-MiniTutorial-3](https://github.com/trashbros/Unity-MiniTutorial-3-Getting-Camera-Data) and will be adding a MATLAB script to receive and display the images sent from Unity.

Associated tutorial walkthrough is [Here](https://trashbros.wordpress.com/?p=40).
